# embree-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beltegeuse/embree-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beltegeuse/embree-rs)

A Rust wrapper for Intels' Embree raytracing library. The goal of this library is to not support all embree features provided.

However, any pull request is welcome if you are interested to contribute to this project.

This wrapper is used (and tested) in:

- rustlight: https://github.com/beltegeuse/rustlight

## TODO

- add documentation
- add example and testing
- (maybe) create a crate for more wider diffusion

## Credits

The original code is inspired from https://github.com/anderslanglands/embree-rs.
