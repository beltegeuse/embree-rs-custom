# Embree-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beltegeuse/embree-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beltegeuse/embree-rs)

A Rust wrapper for Intel's Embree raytracing library. It short terms goal is to provide easy intersection test in **Rust**. The goal of this library is **NOT** to support all Embree features for the moment. However, I will be pleased to merge any pull request!

This wrapper is used (and tested) in:

- rustlight: https://github.com/beltegeuse/rustlight

Please contact me if your project uses this wrapper so I can update this above list.

## TODO

- add documentation
- add an example of a simple Whitted ray tracing
